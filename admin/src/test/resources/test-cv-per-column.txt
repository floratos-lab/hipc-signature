PanINs are mKate2-positive, as opposed to the abundant stroma, and stain-positive for mucins (Alcian blue). Cytokeratin 19 confirmed ductal differentiation. (E-L) PDAC that developed in a 9-mo-old Pdx1 GEMM-ESC mouse. (E-G) Well-differentiated area from K showing mKate2-expressing invasive glandular lesions. Ductal differentiation was confirmed by CK19 immunohistochemistry in G. (H-J) Poorly differentiated area from K in which cells are mKate2-expressing but mostly stain-negative for cytokeratin 19. (L) Liver metastasis found in the same animal and displaying well-differentiated malignant lesions and abundant stromal desmoplasia. (M) PanINs from a mouse with pancreatic KrasG12D expression, generated by traditional breeding for comparison. Bars, 50 µm if not otherwise specified."

KM survival curve of shPten mice randomized into on-dox (n = 4) and off-dox (n = 4) treatment arms after detection of an 800- to 1100-mm3 pancreatic tumor.  Four weeks to 6 wk after dox deprivation, pancreata still harbor mKate2-positive neoplastic lesions."
