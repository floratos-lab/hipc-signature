blood	UBERON_0000178	A fluid that is composed of blood plasma and erythrocytes.				
cell	CL_0000000	A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane.	The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).			
primary cultured cell	CL_0000001	A cultured cell that is freshly isolated from a organismal source, or derives in culture from such a cell prior to the culture being passaged.	Covers cells actively being cultured or stored in a quiescent state for future use.		unpassaged cultured cell|primary cell culture cell	primary cell line cell
obsolete immortal cell line cell	CL_0000002	OBSOLETE: A cell line cell that is expected to be capable of an unlimited number of divisions, and is thus able to support indefinite growth/propagation in vitro as part of a immortal cell line.	Obsoleted in July 2013 and replaced by the CLO 'immortal cell line cell' class, as a result of CLO-OBI-CL alignment efforts.  Covers cells actively being cultured or stored in a quiescent state for future use.		continuous cell line cell|permanent cell line cell	
native cell	CL_0000003	A cell that is found in a natural setting, which includes multicellular organism cells 'in vivo' (i.e. part of an organism), and unicellular organisms 'in environment' (i.e. part of a natural environment).	To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation. (MAH 1.12.12).			
obsolete cell by organism	CL_0000004	OBSOLETE: A classification of cells by the organisms within which they are contained.	This term was made obsolete because there is no difference in meaning between it and 'cell', as any cell can be classified by its species. If you have used this term in annotation, please replace it with cell (CL:0000000), native cell (CL:0000003), or cell in vitro (CL:0001034) as appropriate.

cultured cell	CL_0000010	A cell in vitro that is or has been maintained or propagated as part of a cell culture.	Note that this class was re-labeled to 'cultured cell' instead of 'cell line cell', as it intent was clarified to cover any cultured cells of multicellular and unicellular organisms. This includes cells actively being cultured, or cells that have been cultured but are stored in a quiescent state for future use. In having been cultured, cells must establish homeostasis and often replicate in a foreign environment. Accomodation of this stress initiates a selection of cells fit for such challenges, wherein necessary adaptive biochemical and.or genetic changes can occur. These changes can set them apart from the in vivo cells from which they derive, and such changes will typically accumulate and change over increasing time in culture.

endothelial cell	CL_0000115	An endothelial cell comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures and can be squamous or cuboidal. In mammals, endothelial cell has vimentin filaments and is derived from the mesoderm.	From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].		endotheliocyte

According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.
